# Microchip-s-PMP-Address-Bus-Demo-with-SRAM
An example of writing 110'000 words to SRAM using the PMP Bus
In this example C file, I use Microchipâ€™s parallel master port (PMP) and the PMP Address Bus to increment some of the address lines on 512k 16bit ISSI SRAM.
This C file is the same code as demonstrated on YouTube.
Thank you.
